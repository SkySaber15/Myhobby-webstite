   <p> My name is Alexander Hernandez. I am just another Guy with a creative and wild imagination. I enjoy writing stories about what ever comes to mind. I plan on using the knowlegde from my programing class to make my on video game action platformer! I will be working with a few friends of mine to build up the art and materials needed to make a great game using the Unity engine. </p><img id="Unity" src="../images/Unity.png" height="100px" alt="Image of Unity" />
